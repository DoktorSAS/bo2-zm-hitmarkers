hitmarkers in bo2 zombies wooooo

if you want the extra details read below:
the _zm_spawner.gsc was modified to match the BO3 version of it, which has the argument "attacker" for the zombies death event. for some odd reason, either the gsc dump i have or
the actual game doesn't have this argument. so, i readded it to the code, and now the hitmarker will still play on the death of the zombie. also, the sound of the hitmarker will not 
work because the sound asset is only available in multiplayer. if anyone what could replicate it lmk
